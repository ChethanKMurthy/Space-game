Hey , this is a result of A javascript course I took from free code camp on Javascript and decided to cook up a game combining something I like - space and Javascript 



To run this game: 
1.Clone the repository
2.If youre new to github: Download all the files and run the Space-game.html 
3.Have fun dodging those planets.


ENJOY!!
